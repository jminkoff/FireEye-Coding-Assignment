# FireEye-Coding-Assignment
Code created for the FireEye Security onboarding process

Open two terminal windows and in one run server.py and in the other run client.py. For the purposes of the assignment I just made the password "password". If the password is entered correctly you will be prompted to write a message to a file. The program will check for an existing output.txt file on the server and client side.

So sorry this is late! Unfortunately this is an extreamly busy time of year for me, some things came up that prevented me from being finished when I would have liked. I appreaciate your patience and interest.
